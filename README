PART 3: Scheduler
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Command Syntax:
    ./schedule [flags] filename

Required arguments:
    filename  is the pathname (absolute or relative) to the input file

Optional flags:
    -h       prints message detailing command line usage
    -P       Enables profiling. Profiling results are printed in a table and
             saved to the file "prof.prof", which can be read by an external
             profiling tool.



PART 2: Register Allocator
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Command Syntax:
    ./412alloc [flags] filename

Required arguments:
    filename  is the pathname (absolute or relative) to the input file

Optional flags:
    -h       prints message detailing command line usage
    -x       Outputs ILOC with registers renamed so each is defined only once
    k        Performs regsiter allocation with k regsiters, where k is an
             integer in the range [3,64]
    -P       Enables profiling. Profiling results are printed in a table and
             saved to the file "prof.prof", which can be read by an external
             profiling tool.

Either the "-x" flag or "k" must be provided (if neither is found,
allocator will report an error and exit). The "-P" flag can be provided
with any other flag.




PART 1: Front End
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Command Syntax:
    ./412fe [flags] filename

Required arguments:
    filename  is the pathname (absolute or relative) to the input file

Optional flags:
    -h       prints message detailing command line usage
    -s       prints tokens in token stream
    -p       invokes parser and reports on success or failure
    -r       prints human readable version of parser's IR
    -P       Enables profiling. Profiling results are printed in a table and saved to the file "prof.prof",
             which can be read by an external profiling tool.

If no optional flag is provided, the default behavior is to invoke the parser
and report success or failure (-p flag). The "-s", "-p", and "-r" flags are mutually
exclusive, if multiple are provided then the highest priority flag will be executed.
